In this class/this project I learn so many integral concepts in software engineering:
1. Testing and unit testing.
2. Docker and docker images.
3. Linters and PyLint.
4. GitHub actions and Bash scripts.
5. Introduction to and extensive use of Regex.
6. BeautifulSoup and web scraping in Python.
7. Software development lifecycle.
8. Developing on multiple branches.
9. GitKraken and SSH into GitHub.
10. Event monitoring and Datadog.

Many other concepts were learned but not directly relevant or used for this project such as agile development, scrum, various concepts in object oriented programming
such as coupling, encapsulation, inheritance vs composition, and experiences working in the software development industry.

Project Description:

My project was a web scraping cliet that compiled the products and information of two butcher shops into CSV files. This class was taken before databases so we didn't store the data that way.
